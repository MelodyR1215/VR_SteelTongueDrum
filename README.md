# VR_SteelTongueDrum
## Overview
This project involved the development of a virtual reality (VR) experience aimed at promoting mental well-being through music therapy and meditation. Built for the Oculus platform using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), the experience allows users to interact with and play steel tongue drums, a musical instrument known for its calming tones, using VR controllers.
## Key Contributions
3D Modeling and Optimization: Led the design and development of high-quality 3D models for the steel tongue drums, crafting tools, and surrounding environment using Blender. The models were optimized for VR performance, ensuring smooth interaction and rendering without compromising visual quality.<br>
Particle System Integration: Integrated advanced particle systems within UE4, utilizing GPU sprite emitters and vector fields to simulate crafting effects, enhancing the immersive quality of the experience. These systems contributed to creating a soothing, meditative environment through dynamic particle flow, adding visual depth and tranquility to the user experience.<br>
Interactive Mechanics: Utilized UE4â€™s Blueprint Visual Scripting to develop the interactive elements of the experience. This included implementing realistic visual and audio feedback for drum interactions, leveraging event-driven programming and custom nodes to ensure the music creation process felt responsive and lifelike.
The project successfully combined elements of meditation, music therapy, and virtual interaction, providing a calming and immersive experience designed to improve users' mental well-being.
